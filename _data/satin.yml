badge: SATIN FRAMEWORK
title: "A Swift/C++ Metal rendering engine. No nodes, all code."
description: |
  Built from the ground up on Metal, Satin gives you direct access to Apple's GPU architecture
  without sacrificing the joy of creative exploration.
  
  <br />

  It's spiritually similar to frameworks like ThreeJS, Processing and OpenFrameworks, but optimized
  for modern Apple platforms and letting you create, build and ship industrial grade apps with confidence.
  
  <br />

  Satin was originally authored by [Reza Ali](https://www.syedrezaali.com) and contributors, and lives on via the Fabric project.
