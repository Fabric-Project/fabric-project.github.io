badge: FABRIC FRAMEWORK
title: "Embeddable Graph Renderer and Interchange Format"
description: |
  Fabric Editor is built on top of Fabric Framework, an embeddable cross platform runtime, so you can
  execute Fabric graphs in your own app on any supported platform. Leverage the Fabric Framework to load .fabric files, create your own 3rd party plugins, and execute
  and render Fabric graphs just like the editor does.

  <br />

  Fabric Framework is a Swift Package making integration easy.
