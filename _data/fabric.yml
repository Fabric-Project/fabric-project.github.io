  Instant feedback, creative flow, wire up complex visuals without writing code. 

  <br>

  Fabric Editor is a modern successor to Quartz Composer, allowing you to work with an organized set of
  data types and to build compelling and complex compositions without writing a single line of code.

  <br />

  Fabric brings an opinionated, user driven experience into the present. Modern rendering. Modern platform support. Modern extensibility.

      Your creativity doesn't live in a vacuum. 

      <br />

      Fabric supports a variety of hardware and software connectivity
      out of the box, letting your composition connect and interact with the outside world.

      <br />

      Mouse and Keyboard input, receive OSC, MIDI, HID and Game controllers signals, connect to Syphon inputs
      and outputs to capture and broadcast live video, and more.

      Fabric supports an expanding suite of machine learning nodes and features such as Face Keypoint Detection,
      Hand Tracking, Image Segmentation, and ML powered scaling and antialiasing.

      <br />

      You can even run Language Language and Vision Language Models locally, in your graph.

      <br />
      
      Model Context Protocol (coming soon) allows for agentic self modification of graphs via natural language.
      Just tell Fabric what you want.

      
      Fabric leverages CoreML, MPS and MLX for neural engine and GPU acceleration of ML workloads.

      Fabric supports a variety of media, including hardware accelerated video (Camera, Quicktime movie playback),
      Image, 3D model import, and soon Gaussian Splats.

      <br />

      Thanks to the Lygia Shader library, Fabric supports a suite of sophisticated and modern GPU processing
      intrinsics, allowing for a diverse combination of image process, signed distance field rendering, path
      tracing, and more.

      <br />

      You can also live code your own Vertex, Fragment or Compute shaders.
