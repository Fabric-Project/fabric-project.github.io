The Fabric project is the new community home for Satin - a Metal GPU rendering engine for Apple platforms written by Reza Ali, and additional community driven projects, documentations and samples that use Satin. 

The first such project is Velvet, an experimental live coding tool that uses Satin's engine to dynamically compile swift modules and execute them.
