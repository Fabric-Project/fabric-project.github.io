The Fabric Project hosts a constellation of software for creating high fidelity fabric interactive graphics on Apple platforms. 

The Fabric project consists of:

## [Satin](https://fabric-project.github.io/satin/)

* Satin is production ready framework for working interactive graphics via  Metal that includes materials, shaders, geometry, a scene graph. 
* Satin supports modern rendering techniques like physically based shading, shadows, tessellation and even ray tracing. 
* Satin supports all modern Apple platforms. 
* Satin is authored by [Reza Ali](http://github.com/rezaali). 
* [Read more about Satin's origins on Reza's portfolio site](https://www.syedrezaali.com/#/satin/) 

## [Fabric](https://fabric-project.github.io/fabric/)

* A new node based editor for [Satin](https://fabric-project.github.io/satin/) that aims to replace gap in tooling that Quartz Composer left. 
* A no code environment lets users build interactive compositions, rapidly iterate and experiment with high fidelity graphics.
* An interchange format for saving compositions.
* An embeddable sdk to load and render Fabric documents.
* Fabric is authored by [Anton Marini](http://github.com/vade). 


## [Velvet](https://fabric-project.github.io/velvet/)

* A (very) experimental live coding environment written in swift inspired by processing - allowing one to live compile and hot load Satin code. 
* Velvet is authored by [Anton Marini](http://github.com/vade). 


The Fabric project aims to maintain and build on [Satin](https://fabric-project.github.io/satin/)'s foundations to bring back an era of high quality, performant and experimental software to the Apple platforms as first class citizens. 

The Fabric Project is spearheaded by [Anton Marini](http://github.com/vade), and is looking to build a community of developers and users to help.
